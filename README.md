# latif | l'AvArt Studio

Architect, Unreal Engine and Digital Twin developer.  
Co-Founder of l'AvArt Studio.

I design and build systems that connect architecture, data, and real-time technology.  
My work focuses on bridging the physical and digital worlds through digital twins, simulation, reality capture, and structured knowledge platforms.

## About

My background combines architecture, software development, and data-driven design.  
I work at the intersection of:

- Architectural design and BIM workflows
- Unreal Engine development (C++ and tools engineering)
- Digital Twin systems and IoT integration
- Photogrammetry and spatial data capture
- Interactive visualisation and real-time simulation
- Research-driven platforms and knowledge infrastructures

I enjoy creating tools that help people understand complex environments through clear, interactive, and meaningful digital experiences.

## Core Areas of Work

### Digital Twins and Spatial Intelligence

Development of **Twinise**, an editor-native digital twin platform integrating:

- BIM and Datasmith workflows
- GIS and geospatial datasets
- IoT telemetry and live data streams
- AI-assisted analysis and interaction
- Real-time visual analytics

Focus areas include context-aware data structures, scalable runtime systems, and high-performance visualisation pipelines.

---

### Unreal Engine Development

Building professional Unreal Engine plugins and tools aimed at production workflows:

- C++ plugin architecture
- Editor tooling and workflow optimisation
- Runtime data systems
- Interactive simulation interfaces
- Pixel Streaming integrations
- Data-driven visualisation

Selected public work is available in the **FAB Plugins Hub** repository.

### Reality Capture and Spatial Documentation

Through **Scanex**, I work on:

- Photogrammetry and large-scale surveying
- Drone-based mapping workflows
- Point cloud processing
- Terrain modelling and spatial analysis
- Scan-to-BIM pipelines

The goal is accurate digital reconstruction supporting design, analysis, and long-term documentation.

### Knowledge and Research Platforms

Building structured knowledge systems designed for collaboration, research, and transparent knowledge growth.

Projects explore:

- Research gap discovery
- Structured moderation and governance models
- Citation-driven knowledge structures
- Data visualisation for complex subjects
